# NicholasOrtiz-Challenge-2
Webpage- Portfolio

##Description
Company webpage complete with landing page displaying company logo, value prop,
list of service, featured content section with "watch now" link to redirect users
to digital theatre (previous work), an about us section, and a contact us link in 
the navigation bar as well as footer.

##Considerations
Responsive design needs to me modified to be a bit more user-friendly (mulit-device use)
Footer sections on all pages need to be altered so that it is far below the other sections.
